Hello Everyone

You may ask why am I doing this? Why am i wasting my time on GitHub when i could be outside with my friends, taking good time? 
Well, the answer is quit easy actually. I have to do that for my studies. On e of my teacher asks us to discover this tool and to read the introduction. So that it is.
I know, a dumb answer for a dumb question.
